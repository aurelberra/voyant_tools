                <p> Collaboration has become a hallmark of Digital Humanities (DH) research.
                    Nonetheless it remains under-discussed and for those not deeply engaged in DH a
                    bit of a mystery. Drawing on recent DH work and publications that engage with
                    questions of DH collaboration in different ways (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#deegan2012">Deegan and McCarthy</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#griffinhayler2016">Griffin and Hayler 2016</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#haylergriffin2016">Hayler and Griffin 2016</a>]), we analyse three types of DH collaboration:
                    1) human-human interactions; 2) human-machine/material interactions; and 3)
                    machine/material-machine/material interactions. We argue that engagement with
                    collaboration processes and practices enables us to think through how DH tools
                    and practices reinforce, resist, shape, and encode material realities which both
                    pre-exist, and are co-produced by them. We suggest that understanding these
                    entanglements facilitates a critical DH in which academic hierarchies and
                    disciplinary preconceptions are challenged.</p>

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Collaboration has become a hallmark of Digital Humanities (DH) research [<a class="ref" href="#nowviskie2012">Nowviskie 2012</a>], with scholars either actively engaging with various
                parties across and outside of the university or becoming increasingly aware that
                this is what they should be, or are at least expected to be, doing. In the European
                survey on scholarly practices and digital needs in the arts and humanities [<a class="ref" href="#costis2017">Costis et al. 2017</a>, 6], for example, seven out of ten Digital Humanities
                researchers said they “often or very often” engage in
                collaboration. Nonetheless, or perhaps because of this generalized
                practice,collaboration has become increasingly taken for granted. However, we would
                like to suggest that it remains under-developed in both theory and practice,
                particularly with regard to partnerships that occur between academic and
                non-academic (typically technical) collaborators and between human and non-human
                actors (which, we argue, might productively be thought of as collaborators in the
                co-production of certain resources and forms of knowledge). Collaboration in DH
                research has not been ignored,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4302e219">[1]</a> but it is still under-discussed in the field,
                particularly with regard to its diversity and subtlety. This can lead to particular
                kinds of omission in the discourse around collaborative projects. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">We were reminded of this during 2014-15 when we co-edited two volumes on <cite class="title italic">Research Methods for Digital Humanities </cite>– one on
                    “reading” digital data [<a class="ref" href="#griffinhayler2016">Griffin and Hayler 2016</a>],
                the other on “creating and curating” such data [<a class="ref" href="#haylergriffin2016">Hayler and Griffin 2016</a>]. The aim of these volumes was to capture some
                sense of the range of research methods that contribute to the Digital Humanities. We
                therefore asked our contributors to discuss the research process of actual DH
                projects they had undertaken, and expected that many of the chapters would include
                some discussion of the collaboration processes integral to that work. But, to our
                surprise, despite the fascinating accounts of DH research we received, we were
                largely met with silence, and even active resistance, to this topic. When we tried
                to elicit more sustained accounts of collaboration, one contributor emailed the
                following: <blockquote><p>The way I/we see it, DH is not a method. It is an
                    explorative field of research where we use digital tools and materials to
                    revisit and map out new ways in the motley field of humanities, with its many
                    different disciplines, often described as a big tent. We try to capture some of
                    this richness in our chapter by addressing central methodological issues we see
                    in different practices in[our disciplinary field]. Going into technical detail
                    in one project is not in our interest, and we do not think it will be useful for
                    the readers of your book to get a detailed technical account when entering a
                    field of constant technological development. What we focus on is rather to set
                    forth more longlasting opportunities and challenges. (Email communication to
                    Griffin and Hayler, 5/6/2015)<a class="noteRef" href="#d4302e247">[2]</a></p></blockquote> We certainly have
                some sympathy with the view that DH is not simply a method, or set of methods,
                though some processes and practices have come to typify the field as it stands. The
                contributor above reinterpreted our request for more detail on the nature of their
                collaborations as meaning a ‘detailed technical account’ which they did not want to
                provide. When we wrote the introduction to <cite class="title italic">Research Methods for
                    Creating and Curating Digital Data in the Digital Humanities</cite> we
                therefore noted: <blockquote><p>
                    As all the contributions to this volume indicate, digitising
                        and curating digital data is a collaborative effort involving multiple
                        disciplines, skills and tools… [but] the engagement with technicians,
                        technology experts, and technologies is often left unaddressed...Indeed, it
                        can be surprisingly difficult to get experienced researchers to discuss this
                        dimension of their work.
                     [<a class="ref" href="#haylergriffin2016">Hayler and Griffin 2016</a>, 3]
                </p></blockquote> How, then, might one promote a rich discussion of collaboration? A useful
                approach can be found in Marilyn Deegan and Willard McCarthy’s collection <cite class="title italic">Collaborative Research in the Digital Humanities</cite>
                [<a class="ref" href="#deegan2012">Deegan and McCarthy</a>]. The contributions to this volume provide an extremely
                varied range of interpretations of what it means to
                “collaborate”, that also offers at least a partial index of the
                academic cultures within which such interpretations are made. We therefore take the
                diversity of approaches of our own two volumes, alongside those in Deegan and
                McCarty’s text, as our point of departure. In this article we do three things: we
                begin with a brief typology of collaborations within the Digital Humanities and then
                analyse the terms in which the types of collaborations we identify tend to be
                discussed by DH scholars, emphasizing the present limits of the discourse whilst
                also highlighting existing best practice. We conclude by exploring some reasons for,
                and ways in which, more nuanced descriptions of collaboration become silenced, and
                by re-emphasizing why such rich elaborations of collaborative research are vital for
                scholarship and pedagogy in the Digital Humanities. Throughout, we suggest that
                paying attention to the complexities of collaboration in DH research has the
                potential to a) broaden the community base, b) strengthen its presence in
                universities, c) demystify its processes, and d) further build an (at times
                posthuman) understanding of how different actors, human and non-human, come together
                in DH collaborations. This last point establishes what we might also more deeply
                learn from studies of collaboration: knowledge is very rarely, if ever, produced by
                individual human beings; coproduction is the typical experience and we politically,
                pedagogically, and practically need a better language for articulating this reality. </div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Collaboration, as a topic, is both normalized and widely discussed by many
                    fields. It is also a practice that is continuously engaged with, either directly
                    or indirectly, by all scholars, since their work a) dialogues with other work
                    and hence with other scholars, and b) near ubiquitously relies on computers for
                    searches, production, storage, and retrieval. In this section we therefore do
                    not claim uniqueness in terms of collaboration underpinning DH, but rather
                    address some of the features of collaboration that have specific salience for
                    DH. We highlight this because the image of the lone Humanities scholar,

                    suggests three types of communication patterns particularly associated with

                    crowdsourcing), and possibly others. Shirkey’s typology is based on human-human
                    interaction, where each set is defined by the number of contributing actants
                    involved and the direction of the most prominent flow of information. In
                    contrast, Timothy Butler and David Coleman [<a class="ref" href="#butler2003">Butler and Coleman 2003</a>] put
                    forward five fundamental models of collaboration, defined instead by how
                    information and knowledge are generated:</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Typologies, such as those above, are useful in elucidating specific aspects of
                    Digital Humanities work. They provide a theoretical, analytical framework for
                    thinking about collaboration rather than mapping its entangled realities. Here,
                    we would like to propose a different typology, designed to capture not just the
                    communication or generation of knowledge, but rather a meta-level focus on all
                    manner of interactions between actants in digital contexts. Such interactions,
                    as outlined, are direction neutral and allow for discussions of the travel of
                    information along any or all routes between collaborators. In this way,
                    interactions can be divided into:</div>
                <div class="ptext"><ol class="list"><li class="item">Human-human interactions </li><li class="item">Human-machine/material interactions </li><li class="item">Machine/material-machine/material interactions</li></ol></div>

                    often within analyses of DH collaboration, though we would argue that their full
                    complexity is frequently overlooked. The third is, currently, the least
                    discussed, but requires further development in response to various new
                    approaches to materialism across the Humanities. Below we expand on each in
                    turn, focusing on the particular frame of academic DH research. It is worth
                    noting at the outset that this is an idealized framework; collaborations often,
                    maybe always, transgress the divisions shown above, with non-human actants
                    influencing human-human collaborations, which then reshape the non-human sphere
                    in turn. Collaboration, as we conceive of it, is truly entangled, developing
                    over time in ways which are complex to track. The proposed typology, therefore,
                    does not describe every collaboration, but rather elements that might appear in
                    every collaborative act. </div>

                    collaborating in producing and/or “farming” data in a joint
                    project, or to the connection between those who have produced Digital Humanities
                    resources and these resources’ end users (we see it as valuable to view such
                    interactions as collaborative precisely because they can result in the
                    co-production of knowledge). Collaboration between human actors is always
                    affected by the experiences and backgrounds from which such actors join the
                        collaboration<a class="noteRef" href="#d4302e413">[7]</a>, and in academic work this is
                    typically most clearly seen in disciplinary divisions. In “Being the Other”, for example, Melissa Terras discusses the
                    relationship between Humanities scholars and their collaborators from Computing
                    or Engineering Science working on DH projects [<a class="ref" href="#terras2012">Terras 2012</a>].
                    Terras argues that in such cross-disciplinary collaborations, “individuals...often find they are the
                                ‘Other’”
                         [<a class="ref" href="#terras2012">Terras 2012</a>, 213], i.e. they experience a profound sense of their own difference as their
                    work is defamiliarised – they are no longer “normal”. With
                    both sides destabilized in this manner, there comes “the need for the construction of roles and
                            responsibilities that allow their skill sets to be admitted to a working
                            team”
                         [<a class="ref" href="#terras2012">Terras 2012</a>, 213]. The team thus often needs to be built from first principles, emphasizing
                    the skills that brought the collaborators together whilst minimizing the
                    friction of competing disciplinary norms (and, indeed, establishing new norms
                    that future collaborations may benefit from deploying). For anyone experienced
                    in interdisciplinary collaboration, there is little that is surprising here, and
                    yet such experiences of alterity, and its legitimate and frequent challenges,
                    are often forgotten or left unarticulated, rendering them as a surprise for each
                    new generation of scholars who might therefore reasonably feel that they, alone,
                    encounter such difficulties. </div>

                    feminist methodological work from the 1980s and 1990s where questions of
                        “what counts” (what knowledge, what skills, what
                    experience etc.) were key to debates about the status of women in the academy
                    and in knowledge production (see e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#harding1987">Harding 1987</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#hartsock1998">Hartsock 1998</a>]). Underlying such questions of “what
                        counts” are (often deep-seated) inequalities, more or less
                    consciously acknowledged hierarchies of knowledge, method, and practice that
                    have led Willard McCarthy to suggest that “true collaboration within a group
                        happens rarely” because it requires an “un-boss”’,
                    someone, according to McCarthy, who is “<em class="term">primus inter

                    feminist research when the discipline of Women’s or Gender Studies was seeking
                    to establish and legitimize its work in academia (just as DH has been doing, in
                    its current form, since around the turn of the century). The early feminist
                    demands for the recognition of equality within knowledge production were very
                    much concerned with the inclusion of women in the academy (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#gluck1991">Gluck and Patai 1991</a>]); the recognition of the co-production of knowledge
                    between researchers and those researched [<a class="ref" href="#oakley1982">Oakley 1982</a>], and an
                    attendant reduction in the assumptions of power differences between these; and
                    the inclusion and support of diverse research methods and processes. In a
                    similar fashion, most of the current debates in the Digital Humanities about
                    status, “being the other”, inclusion, legitimation, and
                    support revolve around status markers and power differentials between different
                    kinds of knowledge workers, and in particular between a) those who are
                    Humanities scholars and those who come from a technology or engineering
                    background, and b) academic and non-academic partners (there can be, and often
                    are, overlaps between a) and b)). </div>

                    discusses how the construction of technical staff as “support
                        services” tends to figure these staff as occupying marginal or
                    secondary roles (the “secretaries” or services providers – in
                    feminist terms – of DH), and “the diminutive term
                        ‘techie’” frequently reinforces that relegation [<a class="ref" href="#bradley2012">Bradley 2012</a>, 11]. Bradley addresses this tendency directly
                    in terms of power, arguing that in software development the need to involve the
                    external user in software design constitutes a model form of power sharing that
                    is often ignored [<a class="ref" href="#bradley2012">Bradley 2012</a>, 17]. Unsurprisingly, given
                    the emphasis on individual research publications in the UK, Bradley argues that
                    one way to change entrenched power structures within the Digital Humanities is
                    by “getting status for [technicians’ work] by framing it in
                            the context of doing research...[i.e.] reporting the results by writing
                            about them”
                         [<a class="ref" href="#bradley2012">Bradley 2012</a>, 18]. He himself reported directly on the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise
                    and on the “research outputs” that King’s College London
                    submitted, even though there was no separate panel for Digital Humanities (as
                    was also the case for Women’s and Gender Studies in their beginnings, and was
                    again the case in the most recent such exercise in 2014). The desirability of
                    submitting to such exercises in order to gain status is certainly up for debate,
                    but here we want to focus on the fact that Bradley’s discussion of power
                    differences among staff involved in DH projects explicitly recognizes status
                    differences and inequalities between academic and
                        “professional” staff (his terms) as one of the central
                    issues in DH collaboration. This may also work the opposite way, for instance
                    when technical staff are “the experts” that understand how to
                        “translate” a potential project into digital form, not
                    least as the requirement of complex digital work becomes the norm in research
                    projects, with masculinized tech workers dominating institutional discussions,
                    and commanding spending decisions, over a feminized academic class (not least as
                    these gendered differences often manifest as gender differences). </div>

                            technical processability on the one hand, and the drive towards critical

                    diversity across disciplines which makes collaborative work so desirable – the
                    same friction which produces hierarchical thinking, factions, and the need for
                    McCarty’s “primus inter pares” might also be marshaled,
                    instead, to produce the new thinking required to solve a problem or spot the
                    absences produced by particular knowledge domains’ norms and traditions. Such
                    solutions might well end up contributing to the very consistency and
                    processability that their necessary friction is so often positioned as
                    inhibiting. Flanders’ own response, to move beyond a survival-of-the-fittest
                    model of approaches to intellectual labour, is to try to define “the precise role of dissent within our collaborative

                    quasi-evolutionary social politics, Geoffrey Rockwell discusses it as a relative
                    challenge, “not, I believe, to traditional individual research, but
                            to the organization of professional scholarship in general”
                         [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2012">Rockwell 2012</a>, 151]. Writing from a North American context, he distinguishes between
                        “the professoriate” and “amateur
                        researchers” (terms redolent of earlier notions such as the
                        “gentleman scholar”), proposing that “while we never believed that the professoriate should
                            have special legal privileges, we have acted as if we were a special
                            caste of intellectual worker who should be supported by society and
                            protected with administrative mechanisms like tenure”
                         [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2012">Rockwell 2012</a>, 151]. Such a statement, which also articulates power differentials of the same
                    order as those discussed above, seems somewhat surprising in 2017. In describing
                    the supposed challenge that will occur when “the distinction between the professoriate and amateur
                            researchers…blur[s] as more and more research is shared through social
                            media”
                         [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2012">Rockwell 2012</a>, 15], Rockwell inadvertently (we assume) re-asserts the power and status
                    differentials that he regards as being threatened. The reader feels transported
                    back in time when Rockwell claims that “crowdsourcing projects provide structured ways to
                            involve the growing numbers of well-educated amateurs with time on their
                            hands. . . Such projects . . . provide educated amateurs with a
                            meaningful way to use their leisure time”
                         [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2012">Rockwell 2012</a>, 151–2] – in other words, a form of “rational recreation” as
                    advocated in the 19th century to contain and control unruly workers and amateur
                    researchers. Far from recognizing a challenge to the standing of the
                        “professoriate,” this manner of speaking reproduces
                    certain conventions with regard to who is expected to have power and who is seen
                    to be any knowledge production’s final arbiter and owner. Rockwell, overall,
                    endorses co-production with the “crowd,” but established,
                    arboreal hierarchies remain the norm over more rhizomic understandings of the
                    generation of work. One might put a very simple question: if research could not
                    be produced without the crowd, does it make any sense to diminish their
                    contribution, or to see the academic as working in isolation and merely
                    facilitated by an instrumentalized general public, the crowd figured as a
                    neutral tool (i.e. something put to predictable ends with no effects of their
                    own)? We discuss the (im)possibility of neutral instrumentalization below in the
                    section on machine/material-machine/material interactions, but, as Gabriel
                    Wolfenstein’s chapter on crowdsourcing shows (see below), it is a mistake to
                    view the crowds that are sourced as un-invested or as purely, or neatly, a means
                    to a research end [<a class="ref" href="#wolfenstein2016">Wolfenstein 2016</a>]. </div>

                    the vicissitudes of DH collaboration. As she writes: “I have encountered my fair share of disasters. Shall I
                            be honest? Things have gone horrendously wrong, often between
                            individuals who are supposed to be working closely together”
                         [<a class="ref" href="#terras2012">Terras 2012</a>, 222]. Terras suggests that: <blockquote><p>
                        Most failures in projects...stem from a lack of
                            communication. Perceived slights of status or disputed ‘ownership’ of
                            published outcomes have ruined what promised to be an interesting and
                            fruitful working relationship. Those employed to do complex
                            computational tasks have not had the desired skill set after all,
                            meaning deliverables are not delivered.

                    research, but that they are able to do so by pressuring collaborators into
                    promising too much, or blinding them to the complexity of projects that rely on
                    still-new methods and practices. </div>

                    about the challenges and failures of human-human collaboration, the
                    documentation of which is both rare and yet absolutely necessary in order to

                    distorted, or abandoned may have just as much to tell collaborators as the

                    [<a class="ref" href="#haylergriffin2016">Hayler and Griffin 2016</a>], that volume’s contributions did also
                    indicate that not everything always went to plan. Mats Deutschmann, Anders
                    Steinvall, and Anna Lagerström’s chapter on “Raising
                        Language Awareness Using Digital Media: Methods for Revealing Linguistic
                        Stereotyping”, for example, details how voice manipulation through
                    voice morphing software (intended to manipulate the way that participants read
                    subjects’ gender) always sounded artificial and thus made it difficult to know
                    if participants’ responses to the voices that they heard were due to the
                    particular characteristics of a voice, such as sounding
                        “female/feminine”, or to the
                        “unnaturalness” or artificiality of the voice’s tone [<a class="ref" href="#deutschmann2016">Deutschmann et al. 2016</a>]. This is an important finding, not only because
                    it points to a key issue in technological embodiment, namely how to make the
                    non-human seem convincingly human, but it also highlights that a significant
                    proportion of DH research is currently exploratory in nature, both in its
                    research questions, but also in its emerging methodologies and technical
                    requirements. Hence Deutschmann et al’s findings cannot be described as
                        “negative” or as leaving them with “nothing to
                        show for their efforts”. Rather, they offer (in a similar way to
                    Terras) a particular result in a chain of work that may eventually lead to
                    better voice morphing technology and hence to better ways of teaching people
                    about the effects of the particularities of voice on the hearer. </div>

                    of data and tools produced in the academy that find application and use outside
                    of that space, although she also argues that “the humanities computing community has not been

                    uses of data and tools by a “wider”, hence unknown, public.
                    This form of collaboration is cast as a supply-and-demand structure where
                    academics act as producers and “wider society” (amorphously
                    construed) as consumers. There is no immediate interaction except via the
                    machine, i.e. this collaborative mode pushes at the boundaries of human-human
                    contact, though we would argue that such contact is <em class="emph">mediated</em> by the
                    secondary and simultaneous human-machine/material interaction rather than wholly
                    replaced by it; in terms of the use of tools to produce knowledge, there is a
                    useful sense in which the producers of the tool and the end user co-produce the
                    final output, with the producers’ share of the input being hugely variable
                    across different projects and tools. This also further reveals that our typology
                    of interactions does not describe research activity in mutually exclusive terms
                    – interactions between actants nearly always overlap and coshape one another,
                    for example where academic transdisciplinary partnerships intersect with
                    interactions with technicians recruited to facilitate such new collegiate
                    research and the equipment that they bring to such tasks. </div>

                    crowdsourcing. As Gabriel Wolfenstein has argued, “knowing your
                        crowd” is key; here collaboration is about the give and take
                    between researchers and researched, or knowledge owners [<a class="ref" href="#wolfenstein2016">Wolfenstein 2016</a>]. Wolfenstein offers an illuminating account of
                    how the project <cite class="title italic">Living with the Railroads</cite><a class="noteRef" href="#d4302e841">[11]</a> required sustained engagement with the rail
                    fan community, guaranteed well beyond the lifetime of the project, in order to
                    gain access to the materials held in the community. This investment was achieved
                    by inviting several rail fans onto the Crowdsourcing Trains Advisory Board.
                    These members, and the wider fan community, were then encouraged to act both as
                    sources for core material for the project and as end users. This virtuous circle
                    was both enabling and productive, but it required long-term commitment outside
                    of the explicit project parameters. One might wonder to what extent there is an
                    appetite for this kind of commitment amongst academics who may not regard
                    crowd-sourcing as the collaborative co-production of research, but rather as the
                    potential to draw on existing communities as an instrumentalized resource, i.e.
                    as another tool for getting research done and nothing more. </div>

                    primarily the relative status of collaborators in terms of pre-existing
                    disciplinary and functional hierarchies, the standing of those people within
                    their research communities and collaborations, and the perceptions of such from
                    outside. For UK academics, collaboration is often filtered through the lens of
                    the REF which, in many respects, does not favour collaboration. In this
                    environment, technicians and non-academic partners can be constructed as
                        “second-class citizens”, the feminized servants of the
                    collaboration process who simply facilitate the “real”
                    academic work. But such attitudes may well contribute to the kinds of failures

                    tools, Haraway’s cyborgs, Jane Bennett’s entangled vibrant matter [<a class="ref" href="#bennett2010">Bennett 2010</a>], and what Karen Barad terms the
                        “intra-action” of humans and matter have dramatically
                    changed perceptions of materiality and nonhuman agency in human affairs [<a class="ref" href="#barad2007">Barad 2007</a>]. There is now an increasing recognition of how
                    materiality shapes and circumscribes human action in entangled processes and/or
                    complex systems, rather than human-machine/material intra-action being a one-way
                    street with humans exclusively setting the direction. With work in DH exploring
                    tools alongside texts, we argue that an understanding of machines as
                    collaborators in knowledge production, and an awareness of the impacts of
                    materiality on such production, becomes a disciplinary as well as philosophical
                    concern. Materials and machines materialize; new materialisms conceive of matter
                    as exhibiting agency [<a class="ref" href="#coole2010">Coole and Frost 2010</a>, 7] and resonate with
                    posthuman philosophies aimed at moving an understanding of human action from
                    impositions of human will on inert stuff to contexualized and contingent
                    processes in intra-action with lively matter. Such recognition challenges any
                    understanding of collaboration as a solely human activity; it demands that we
                    conceive of the agency of the material/machine, a fact to which DH scholars pay
                    some, but still limited, attention. This is evident, for instance, in Cecilia
                    Lindhé et al.’s chapter for us on “Curating Mary
                        Digitally”, concerned with the question of how medieval
                    representations of Mary might be effectively remediated digitally [<a class="ref" href="#lindhé2016">Lindhé et al. 2016</a>]. Lindhé et al. accept N. Katherine Hayles’, and
                    others’, assertion that “the remediation and organization of knowledge shapes
                            our thoughts and actions”
                         [<a class="ref" href="#lindhé2016">Lindhé et al. 2016</a>, 142], and for that reason the team wanted to move away from a simply mimetic
                    reconstruction of representations of Mary. Instead they decided to “direct attention to physical interaction and to the
                            materiality of the work”
                         [<a class="ref" href="#lindhé2016">Lindhé et al. 2016</a>, 147], substituting mimesis with the creation of digital interfaces that
                    reacted to their viewers’ movements. Whilst this approach shifts attention from
                    the work as product to the work as a text produced in the process of viewing, it
                    does not inherently move away from attributing the primary or dominant agency to
                    the human. The reproductions are seemingly given some active role, but it is the
                    viewers’ movements that determine what is seen; the performance aspect of the
                    exhibition grants the material a secondary agency that remains subsidiary to the
                    human viewer. Lindhé et al. offer a great model of the kind of approach that can
                    lead to matter being made more obviously vibrant in the digital display of
                    artworks, but in this work the object’s most visible agency remains parasitic
                    off human input. Such an approach was important for the team since they
                    explicitly wanted to privilege the aesthetic and humanistic over the
                    technological, following Johanna Drucker’s injunction not to be overwhelmed by
                    computational methods, or to grant them primacy [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2009">Drucker 2009</a>].
                    Lindhé et al.’s work shows how digitization can be deployed in producing new and
                    conscious efforts to reframe materiality, but it also signals the continued
                    struggle over how the human and the material might be integrated, or conceived
                    of as integrated, without having to hierarchize their roles. In any interaction
                    there may always be a dominant actant (or actants); in Latour’s terms, they are
                    equally actors even if they do not act equally. The challenge comes in
                    materializing the real agency of actants which are not human such that we might
                    better realize the complex roles that they can play in the co-production of
                    knowledge and experience. </div>

                    important for DH. For our purposes here, such understanding may refer to the

                    distinctive physicalities and entailed effects of paper and electronic page

                    acts on the user, inviting her to engage physically by clicking and scrolling,
                    and mentally by encouraging rhizomic or networked, as opposed to linear,
                    readings. Hyperlinks challenge the default grammars of the book-bound context
                    and promote novel forms of engagement that co-shape the ways in which the human
                    reader responds to the text – as Hayler states, hyperlinks are reminders of the
                    possibilities for connection inherent in every written word. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">In discussing the raw materiality of the printed or pixelated page, however,
                    Hayler joins Hayles, Kirschenbaum, and Hayles in assessing how the materiality
                    of each medium can significantly structure the reading experience without
                    requiring a more obvious human interaction such as the following of a link.
                    Hayler shows how media, far from being parasitic on human agency, in fact
                    structure the agency of their users, altering their sense of their potentials.
                    In identifying the histories of the use of pages, with their inherent tendency
                    toward promoting e.g. linearity and fixity, and the newly forged histories of
                    screens, with their tendency towards promoting networked and transient
                    information, Hayler shows how materiality might become bound up with the content
                    of the writing itself in producing meaning, something which feels particularly
                    weighted at a moment of transition between two significant forms. By exploring
                    such entanglements of matter and meaning we can better understand how all texts
                    are co-shaped by a reader, a script, a medium, and a context, each of which
                    possesses its own meaning-making histories. Whilst reading remains a human-led
                    pursuit, there is a posthuman reshuffling of agency here, removing the human
                    from the centre and re-invisioning the reader as a co-constructor of meaning.
                    Hayler ends by suggesting that “digital technology is becoming humanized: made subtle,
                            not jarring, truly deep, not ghostly or shallow, and
                            meaning-rich”
                         [<a class="ref" href="#hayler2016b">Hayler 2016b</a>, 31]. Humanization is here conceived of as reducing difference (which echoes
                    the reduction of otherness between academics in different fields, or between
                    academics and technicians (or crowds), in the human-human interactions discussed
                    above), the recognition of sameness, not just in the comparison of digital text
                    with print’s cultural caché, but also compared to the extent and depth of its
                    material agency and its parity with the human in being an actant in the
                    entanglement that produces the text to be read. That issue of material devices
                    as legitimate and agential actants is central to a full understanding of
                    human-material/machine collaboration.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">In “The Object and the Event: Time-Based Digital Simulation
                        and Illusion in the Fine Arts”, Stephen Hilyard discusses the
                    creation of simulations through digital tools [<a class="ref" href="#hilyard2016">Hilyard 2016</a>]. This
                    chapter analyses two distinct forms of collaboration between human and non-human
                    actants – that between an artist and her digital tools, and that between a
                    digital object and its viewer. The former collaboration, however, is couched in
                    terms of subservience (of the tools to the maker), and the latter reveals the
                    digital object to possess agency only in relation to its being viewed, creating
                    a psychological and/or physiological reaction that the viewer cannot escape.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">As traditionally conceived, the artist, as authority and meaning-maker, remains
                    both in control of her tools and her deployment of them in the manipulation of
                    the viewer. The idea of the tool as an object that the user deploys in order to
                    achieve a particular end is a conception of intrinsic subsidiarity; in the
                    manufacturing of the artistic simulations that Hilyard describes, hardware and
                    software provide a service. Hilyard explores such manipulations in the context
                    of the realistic simulation of impossible effects, from the “uncanny
                        valley” of images of close-to-but-not-quite real humans to the
                    visually accurate rendering of things that could never exist or act as they do
                    outside of the simulation, things that trick the viewer with a blend of
                    photorealism and the subversion of physics. This sets up a classic fine art
                    paradigm where authority accrues to the artist as maker: the digital tools are
                    just that, and in being seen as subservient to the user, as instrumentalized
                    matter, their own agency is neglected. Similarly, the viewer is seen as being
                    worked upon by the art work rather than entangled with it in the co-production
                    of meaning, an interesting inversion of the hierarchy of human and object as
                    opposed to its flattening – to understand objects as entangled, we argue, is not
                    simply to reverse extant understandings (such that humans become slaves to their
                    artefacts sometimes), but instead to appreciate how agency might always flow
                    back and forth, with humans impacting on technologies and the ways in which they
                    might be deployed, and technologies impacting on their users such that the
                    outcome of use is not determined by either side.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">In this vein, throughout the work of the new materialists introduced at the start
                    of this section, we find a much more sustained recognition of the role of tools,
                    artefacts, and objects more broadly in both human affairs and wider networks
                    (where humans might not even be involved in some collusions, as we shall discuss
                    in the next section). The post-phenomenologist Don Ihde, for example, offers a
                    taxonomy of technological interactions: embodiment relationships (where the
                    artefact melts away, such as using a hammer or tennis racquet); hermeneutic
                    relationships (where the tool both enables and modifies perceptions as it is
                    perceived through, such as using a microscope, telescope, or machine readout);
                    alterity relationships (where the machine is an explicit object of concentration
                    apart from the user, such as using an ATM machine); and background relationships
                    (where the device is set and then modifies the background of experience without
                    further interaction, such as the use of a thermostat and household
                        heating).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4302e1005">[14]</a> In Ihde’s breakdown of engagements,
                    we start to see the myriad ways in which technologies both explicitly and subtly
                    flavor and condition experience, becoming a part of our perceptions and, in some
                    instances, enabling them to happen at all. Edwin Hutchin’s work on
                        “distributed cognition” (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#hutchins1996">Hutchins 1996</a>]) similarly demonstrates the extent to which tools might enable the conception
                    of action, as well as facilitating it, and even further displaces the human from
                    the centre of action. His description of navigation on board large naval ships,
                    and the tasks undertaken by combinations of personnel and equipment,
                    combinations that elide neat boundaries between human and non-human actors, sees
                    the network of actants as a distributed system that can legitimately be seen as
                    cognizing; it is the <em class="emph">system</em> which thinks, and only the system which
                    can have these kinds of thoughts. In the absence of the non-human actors nothing
                    could be done, and certainly not done like this; no one human has control and
                    everyone and everything plays their part toward the goal.</div>

                    non-humans co-produce knowledge. What we take from the work of Ihde and
                    Hutchins, and the science studies of Latour, Pickering, Haraway, and Baird, are
                    that tools are never neutral. They, like technicians and crowds, are more
                    rightly thought of as collaborators, whether they are conceived of as such by
                    their users or not. Latour, Pickering, and Hutchins, in particular, are
                    sensitive to the ways in which tools’ users, especially in technical and
                    scientific contexts, are typically loathe to see the machines with which they
                    work as anything but neutral. As with human-human collaborations, much is
                    invested in the tools not interfering with the results and in the production of
                    knowledge being ascribed to the individual (and “excellent”
                    researcher), not to anyone/anything she might have depended upon. A profound
                    silence can emerge from hoping to avoid the comment sometimes offered to

                    Hunyadi’s university in Debrecen has created a cognitive robotics lab into which
                    a system of secondary labs without robots is to be networked in order to allow

                        “desktop” is much more closely linked with your physical reality, and in
                        which social interactions play a central and practical role.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4302e1121">[17]</a> The derisive conflating of “geeks and
                        IT professionals” aside (another example of the power hierarchies
                    described above), this work is concerned with reducing the boundaries between
                    human and machine, and with creating a cybernetic homosocial triangle [<a class="ref" href="#kosofskysedgwick1985">Kosofsky Sedgwick 1985</a>] between human operators and the virtual
                    spaces in which they remotely collaborate on projects, their object of exchange.

                    are all shot from the perspective of the human in his computer room or lab
                    space, looking at the screen. In one video, a robot in the actual room,
                    child-sized relative to the adult male manipulating it, is walking, imitating
                    the adult’s steps whilst the robot is also simultaneously projected into the

                    even if remotely. The primacy of the human remains clearly in view here, both

                    grandmasters of the game Go, a territory-claiming game that, unlike chess and
                    checkers, computers have struggled to compete at, even with only moderately
                    above-average players, due to the human “feel” required.
                    There are so many possible permutations of the board that the “brute
                        force” strategies that AIs have tended to draw on in simpler games
                    (trying out as many hypothetical moves as possible before settling upon the best
                    one and playing it in each situation) are simply too time- and
                    computation-hungry to be viable. AlphaGo instead used a combination of human
                    programming, brute force searches, and machine learning – it played a huge
                    number of games against both human and computer opponents in order to train

                    assumed to have equalled the leading player in some ineffable category outside
                    of mastery of the game. But AlphaGo was still heavily dependent on human
                    interaction – it was programmed by humans, played against human players in
                    training so as to learn from them, and was explicitly aiming at human-like
                    performance in its first incarnations, having millions of moves from expert

                    not neutral: their biases and limitations can flavour a whole system. AGZ’s

                        This view oversimplifies skills acquisition and maintenance for both
                        academics and technicians, and does not recognise the actual practices of

                        forthcoming is also related to the issue of technology as such: as the
                        writer of the email quoted at the outset of this article suggests,
                            “constant technological development”, and by
                        implication the obsolescence that accompanies contemporary digital
                        technology, makes discussions of specific technical processes difficult or
                        seemingly undesirable due to fears that these discussions will rapidly
                        become obsolete as the technology changes. Two issues strike us. The first
                        is simple: there is always something to learn from prior practice, and no
                        shift in the technological apparatus of Digital Humanities research is
                        likely to be so great a rupture that all prior work is rendered irrelevant.
                        Secondly, Susan Hockey makes the point that “Humanities source material lasts for a very long
                                time and digital representations of that material need to be equally
                                long-lived”
                             [<a class="ref" href="#hockey2012">Hockey 2012</a>, 87]. She discusses the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) which was set up
                        precisely to ensure this for the digital rendering of script sources. As
                        Hockey notes, “[o]ne of the original aims of the TEI was to create
                                an encoding scheme that would be independent of any particular
                                computing system”
                             [<a class="ref" href="#hockey2012">Hockey 2012</a>, 87]. Withdrawal of public funding, however, curtailed this effort and
                        expertise was thus lost. In this way, the speed of technological development
                        can lead to the silencing of discussions of its practices. Tensions exist,
                        for instance, between the development and commodification of technology on
                        the one hand, and its usability across time and space on the other: the
                        enhancement of a technology’s functionality typically correlates with its
                        accelerated commodification such that consumers clamour to buy the latest
                        machine and/or app, even if they are unable to fully use the ever-increasing
                        opportunities afforded by their current or new technologies [<a class="ref" href="#gerpott2013">Gerpott et al. 2013</a>]. Academics may thus become increasingly
                        distanced from the technical experts that they require in order to undertake
                        DH projects as the gaps between known and unknown potential deepen, and at

                        academe [<a class="ref" href="#strathern2000">Strathern 2000</a>] and which continuously flavour the
                        point above. Such imperatives have led to the simultaneous rise of
                        collective work <em class="emph">and</em> individualized accountability in a context
                        of heightened competition – competition to be
                            “world-class”, “excellent”, indeed
                            <em class="term">primum</em> without <em class="term">pares</em>. Where collaborative
                        research is submitted to the REF, for example, the collaborators have to
                        specify what exactly their contribution is. But such specification is
                        largely anathema to proper collaborative efforts and goes against our
                        understanding of creative thinking as a collective and intricately entangled
                        process involving a range of human and non-human interactions. It ultimately
                        denies the “co” of collaboration and, due to its
                        competitive underscoring, reinforces pre-existing inequalities between
                        different kinds of collaborators. As described above, this is partly
                        supported by the hierarchies within academe which construe certain staff as
                        subsidiary and which continue to instrumentalize both tools and people
                        rather than recognising them as co-producers of knowledge. </div>

                        supports contemporary new materialist and posthumanist stances – the

                        meaning-making; the lack of access to things outside of the text (or
                        context) does not mitigate their role in producing what we can perceive, and
                        how troubled and slippery text must always be demonstrates how we can be
                        fooled in our pursuit of truth; and the vagaries of economic and cultural
                        forces and the inscriptions and material properties of the authored and

                        activity. Neoliberalism’s focus on individual achievement leaves little time

                    manifold. For one thing, such silences undermine a certain deliberative approach
                    to education and research which acknowledges the processes that inform that
                    education. This lack of acknowledgment means that processes are constructed as
                    inadvertent and hence beyond our agency. It fosters a “learned helplessness”
                         [<a class="ref" href="#seligman1972">Seligman 1972</a>] and leads to situations where academics in their 40s talk of themselves
                    as “dinosaurs” because they do not engage with, are alienated
                    from, and think they cannot understand contemporary technologies.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4302e1385">[21]</a>
                    We see this effect most clearly at every academic gathering that involves
                    technology where, almost unfailingly, something (a PowerPoint presentation, a
                    video clip, the interface between laptop and data projector) does not work, the
                    presenter (usually a researcher or academic) does not know how to make it work,
                    and no technician to facilitate the process can be found. Such disjunctures and
                    competence issues are a norm rather than an exception in academe, and point to
                    divisions (human-human, human-machine, machine-machine) that the silence around
                    collaboration only serves to reinforce and exacerbate. It also has the effect of
                    individualizing this experience, suggesting individualized rather than systemic
                    failures to address and deal with such disjunctures. </div>

                    that both academics and students use, whether they do DH in a deliberative
                    fashion or not. In her interviews with staff in Sweden working in DH
                    environments, Griffin found that such staff often disavow DH as an academic
                    field precisely because of the ubiquity of digitality. Such ubiquity can lull
                    institutions into a sense of non-responsibility, where the mere existence of
                    Google-based online tools, for instance, can suggest that universities or
                    research centres need only participate in this cornucopia rather than consider
                    how this plenitude might require changes to their curricula, delivery, and
                    attitudes towards digitality. But purposive participation, such as we would
                    advocate, and which has to include discussions of collaboration at its core (for
                    instance of distance-collaborations with unknown others who produce tools, farm
                    data created through the use of those tools by scholars, and incite further
                    uses), is critical to becoming and being an effective researcher and scholar,
                    indeed a participant, in contemporary (digital) cultures. We would suggest that
                    the pervasive “fake news” and “fake media”
                    rhetoric of the current moment in part arises from the lack of a critical

                    collaboration that already occurs automatically, and its effects must be
                    addressed. We have hardly begun with this in the Digital Humanities. Failure to
                    address this increases digital divides between those seemingly in the know,
                    those who under-value the skills and knowledges they actually do have, and

                    that institutions have become used to the idea that Humanities ‘cost nothing’.
                    This respondent (the director of a DH laboratory that had eye-tracking
                    equipment, scanners, and a whole range of other electronic devices used to
                    conduct various kinds of DH research) had a strong sense that institutions
                    needed to be educated about the fact that the Humanities, and in particular DH,
                    also require capital resources to both establish and maintain themselves. And,
                    whilst there have been related critiques of the needs for certain kinds of DH
                    resources (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#vanzundert2012">van Zundert 2012</a>]), the basic point that DH
                    requires resources is well taken and becomes more apparent in the context of
                    discussing collaboration since it refuses the rhetoric of the lone scholar,
                    needing only to be equipped with pen and paper, that continues to haunt the
                    Humanities. A related issue here is that institutions need plans for their
                    technology development which includes the re- and up-skilling of staff as well
                    as material resources. Such planning continues to be somewhat haphazard.
                    Rosenblum and Dwyer, for example, note that the fact that as co-directors of a
                    DH Centre they were given 25% and 50% time respectively – clearly not enough to
                    fulfil all their tasks.</div>

                    from the processes of DH projects. The development of a large body of
                    methodological literature around interviewing, for example, has produced
                    important insights into the dynamics between interviewers and interviewees,
                    leading to a foundational example of the contemporary notion of knowledge as
                    co-produced and situated [<a class="ref" href="#hartsock1998">Hartsock 1998</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#griffin2016">Griffin 2016</a>]. This understanding, in many ways, goes against DH
                    traits such as the standardization of knowledge into readable data, as an effect
                    or requirement of digitization, and the deterritorialization of knowledge that
                    this implies, leaving DH, at times, troubled by the tension between variability
                    and standardization [<a class="ref" href="#flanders2012">Flanders 2012</a>], between the unpredictable and

                    spaces. This results in a reinforcement of the failure to transform the social
                    and political structures of the academy, something that is necessary both in

                    constructing resistance to technology by making it into the unknown. This is
                    also reinforced by a lack of recognition in higher education institutions that
                    digital competence is a skill that needs to be acquired and maintained in a
                    manner akin to Sennett’s craftsman’s training. Such training is often
                    unavailable in academe, not recognized in terms of time and work requirements,
                    and left to the perspicacity and perseverance of individual staff. This results
                    in a DH skills shortage that currently manifests itself in the limited numbers
                    of staff knowing limited numbers of DH tools. In turn, this means that the
                    development of new research ideas and related critiques of DH cannot flourish
                    nor can the collaborations that makes the best DH research so stimulating. It’s

                    places and digital technologies.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4302e1475">[24]</a> The project will also result in a co-authored academic book,
                    with no lead author, that includes contributions from, and interviews with the
                    writers and technicians working on the pieces. There will, further, be a
                        “cookbook” aimed at demonstrating, for those interested
                    in the production of these kinds of works, the options and opportunities
                    currently available, i.e. what tools, technicians, budgets, and readers will
                    permit. An edited collection will further gather voices from across writing,
                    publishing, technical production, and academia. Maybe the project is cheating –
                    it was devised to investigate the ways in which collaborations between humans,
                    technologies, and environments manifest and alter in a landscape of ubiquitous
                    mobile computing. But it demonstrates what voices should be included and the
                    balance of power that might be achieved; no one academic gets to be the
                        <em class="emph">primus</em> deploying everyone else as instruments of knowledge

                    for the production, the second to enable the movement of characters, sounds, and
                    settings between real and virtual environments), it is clear that, again, the
                    roles of academic, non-academic, technical, and non-human collaborators will
                    need to be carefully considered. It would now seem impossible to think of the
                    work simply accruing to the two academics on the project team, with all other

                    easy, and undoubtedly important, to resist the silencing outlined above. It
                    boils down to two calls: the first is to recognize that no collaborator can ever
                    be neutral, and the second that, therefore, their roles must be understood as
                    well as possible, before, during, and after the event. Credit and blame need to
                    be attributed, expressed, and shared. That’s how we get better.</div>
