                <p>This study used three interdependent techniques to help understand the use and
                    distribution of syllabic values of the cuneiform signs during the second half of
                    the third millennium and early second millennium BCE. The results suggest that,
                    during this period, cuneiform syllabaries were variable. That variation can
                    further inform us about the regional, temporal, and dialectical contexts in
                    which they existed. The addition of this research to the wider literature on the
                    early adaptation of cuneiform enhances the field's understanding of how
                    cuneiform syllabic values began to emerge and spread across the ancient Near
                    East, and demonstrates how computational methods of analysis can be applied to
                    research questions in humanities subjects.</p>

                <h1 class="head">1. Background</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Cuneiform is the earliest writing system attested in history, emerging towards
                    the end of the fourth millennium B.C. in a region of ancient Mesopotamia that
                    corresponds with the southern part of modern-day Iraq. The population first
                    associated with cuneiform spoke an isolate language called Sumerian. However,
                    Semitic-speakers who co-inhabited the same region quickly adapted the script to
                    write their own language, Akkadian. Akkadian is the earliest attested language
                    of the Semitic family, which includes better-known languages such as Arabic,
                    Hebrew, and Aramaic. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The signs that made up this writing system consisted of four types: logograms
                    (sometimes called ideograms), which represented whole words or ideas;
                    syllabograms, which represented whole syllables such as <em class="emph">tu, ta,</em> or
                        <em class="emph">ti</em>; determinatives, which were a set of signs that indicated,
                    in limited circumstances, the category a word belonged to (i.e., gods, trees,
                    precious stones, personal names, etc.); and numerical signs, which belonged to
                    either a decimal or sexagesimal counting system (both systems were used
                    simultaneously in ancient Mesopotamia). Each sign in these categories was
                    crafted by impressing one or more wedge-shaped markings with the aid of a
                    stylus, usually made from a reed cut to have a triangular tip, into the still
                    soft surface of clay tablets (Figure 1). These clay tablets naturally dried and
                    hardened in the arid and hot climate, and as a result they survived in great
                    numbers. This script survived for over 3000 years from around 3300 BC to 70 AD
                    and became the hallmark of Mesopotamian history and culture.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">The spread of Mesopotamian culture from southern Iraq into neighboring regions,
                    including northern Iraq, Turkey, and Syria, coincided with the development of
                    the cuneiform writing system, during the late fourth millennium and first half
                    of the third millennium BC. During the next few hundred years, this writing
                    system was adopted by the populations outside of Mesopotamia that were
                    interacting regularly with Sumer and Babylonia primarily through trade. As the
                    cuneiform system developed and spread, it was adapted to express non-Sumerian
                    words, including personal names. In general, Akkadian and other languages
                    adapted the cuneiform script by means of the same rebus principle used by
                    Sumerian cuneiform to express grammatical affixes [<a class="ref" href="#cooper1996">Cooper 1996</a>, 45]. </div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">In this study<a class="noteRef" href="#d5289e219">[1]</a>,
                    interdisciplinary techniques were used to answer questions about how the
                    cuneiform script, the earliest-attested writing system used between 3300 BCE and
                    100 CE in the ancient Near East, was adapted by Semitic-speaking peoples across
                    Mesopotamia and Syria. The earliest, but scarce, evidence of cuneiform signs
                    being used syllabically to write Semitic words and proper nouns comes from
                    around 2600-2500 BCE. Between 2350 and 1800 BCE, there is an increase in the
                    development and use of signs with syllabic values across Mesopotamia and Syria.
                    These syllabic values (together called “syllabaries”)
                    continue to develop until standardizations of cuneiform signs and their values
                    begin to be enforced around 1800 BCE, which essentially ends any major
                    variability in the script within specific periods. This provides us with a
                    period of almost 600 years, spanning the second half of the third millennium and
                    early second millennium BCE, during which there is a wealth of textual data
                    documenting the first full adaptation of the cuneiform script to syllabically
                    write Semitic words and proper nouns. I investigated differences in the values
                    of cuneiform signs used to write Semitic words excavated from nine sites that
                    produced cuneiform texts during the late third millennium and early second
                    millennium BCE in order to understand the extent to which any variation
                    occurred. This analysis of the variation could then inform other questions about
                    dialect differences, educational practices, and power dynamics across the
                    region.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Individual studies of the signs attested with a syllabic value among the selected
                    Syrian corpora form the basis of this investigation. These studies aim to
                    provide a clear, consistent, and complete description of syllabic value
                    attestations in Syria and Mesopotamia, and the information they provide is
                    concatenated into a table of reconstructed syllabaries for each site. Together,
                    these reconstructed syllabaries form a pan-Mesopotamian dataset informed by the
                    most current knowledge of syllabic values attested at these sites during the
                    roughly 600-year period being examined. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">After curating a dataset of the syllabic values attested at each site, I analyzed
                    the data using three complementary computational methods: <em class="term">phylogenetic
                        estimation</em>, <em class="term">hierarchical clustering</em>, and <em class="term">principal
                        component analysis</em> (PCA). These tools organized the data into visual
                    hierarchies and identified the principal drivers behind the variation observed
                    in the data. The results strongly support the conclusion that geography and time
                    are the most significant factors affecting syllabic value observations across
                    Mesopotamia, which indicated that during this period scribal communities adapted
                    the cuneiform script’s syllabic system independently and continued to use their
                    local syllabaries despite the differences that any individual scribe encountered
                    through his interactions with other communities across the region. The results
                    of the computational analyses then suggested directions of further inquiry: I
                    examined the linguistic environments of the syllabic values that most directly
                    influenced the variation found in the dataset<a class="noteRef" href="#d5289e240">[2]</a>. This component of the research
                    provided evidence for greater dialectical variation across the geographic region
                    than was previously assumed.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">In summary, this research uses a series of three interdependent techniques to
                    determine and understand the use and distribution of syllabic values within the
                    cuneiform writing system during the second half of the third millennium BC and
                    early second millennium BC. The results suggest that during this period
                    cuneiform syllabaries are variable, and that variation can further inform us
                    about the regional, temporal, and dialectical contexts in which they existed.
                    The addition of this research to the wider literature on the early adaptation of
                    cuneiform enhances the field’s understanding of how cuneiform syllabic values
                    began to develop and emerge across the ancient Near East, and demonstrates how
                    computational methods of analysis can be applied to research questions in

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">The aim of this study was to examine the spread and adaptation of syllabic signs

                    for examination must have produced texts wholly or partially written in a

                    and ten of these have been chosen for inclusion in this study due to the number
                    of relevant tablets attested at each site and easy access (either electronic or

                        These three methods are phylogenetic estimation, hierarchical clustering,
                        and principal component analysis. Phylogenetic estimation was included
                        because it is a common method used in the study of language and manuscript
                        evolution [<a class="ref" href="#platnick1977">Platnick and Cameron 1977</a>]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#atkinson2005">Atkinson and Gray 2005</a>] and the results could therefore be more easily
                        compared with previous studies. However, because of the novelty of using
                        phylogenetic systematics to understand writing system evolution, and because
                        of the relative inflexibility of phylogenetic programs to filter out
                        relevant data from noise, two other computational methods, programmed in R
                        within the IDE RStudio, were used to test the results of the phylogenetic
                        estimation model. All three types of analysis were conducted on an Apple
                        laptop. The second two techniques help manipulate, filter, and visualize the
                        data in different ways; they organize the data according to similarities and
                        differences, and can isolate key data points that influence the results.
                        These three methods will be discussed further below.</div>

                        aspects of the data that are skewing the preliminary results: the lack of
                        sufficient data from Assur, and the presence of a large number of signs that
                        only occur at Ebla. The insufficient data from Assur is due to my lack of
                        access to museums in which the corpus is housed. Ebla’s larger number of
                        syllabic sign values may be due to the different methods of determining
                        syllabic values used by me and by the team that published the Ebla
                        syllabary, to dialectical variation, or due to the larger number of
                        non-administrative texts. In order, therefore, to avoid these issues and to
                        avoid possible human error in the syllabaries I reconstructed, all hapax
                        values, or syllabic values at each site that are attested at only one site,

                    strength of phylogenetic analysis is its ability to reconstruct tree- or
                    network-like relationships across time; because the spread and adaptation of

                    relatively short one – these methods can provide interesting insights into the
                    nature of the script’s spread and help us determine which sites cluster or
                    diverge. Phylogenetic methods are advantageous because the data input and
                    methods used are always transparent, and therefore the results should be

                        optimality-criterion-based. Algorithm-based methods rely on algorithms to
                        search for trees and to determine which tree is the correct one, and have
                        the advantage of short computation time. Optimality-criterion-based methods,

                        best — called the optimality criterion — to find the tree in the first place
                        — or the search strategy. This method is advantageous because the use of two
                        different criteria for searching for the trees and for determining which one
                        is best makes it easier to determine the likelihood that the tree produced

                        creates new, random datasets using characters from the original data matrix
                        and runs them through the same set of parameters. This technique can be used
                        simply to estimate support values for the edges of a tree, where the support
                        values are the fraction of times that that particular bipartition appears in
                        the random bootstrap trees; it can also be used as input data in a consensus

                        is notable that Ebla is an outlier among the taxa. The Mari and Tuttul
                        syllabaries seem to be more similar to the rest of the cohort; Nabada and
                        Assur are clustered together. Finally, the phylogenetic estimation groups
                        together the syllabaries of Eshnunna, Kish, Tutub, and Gasur. Aside from the
                        slightly closer relationship between the Mari and the Tuttul syllabaries,
                        which could theoretically be explained by the geographic proximity of these
                        two sites, these results are unexpected and not immediately explainable.
                        Upon closer examination, the grouping of Nabada and Assur together can be
                        explained by the relatively low number of syllabic values attested at each
                        site; although the reasons for this differ for each. As explained above
                        (Section 4.2), insufficient data was available from Assur which impacted the
                        number of syllabic sign values in the reconstructed syllabary. At Nabada, at
                        the other hand, the scribes writing these tablets seem to have used
                        significantly fewer syllabic signs compared to logographic signs. This is an
                        interesting and unexpected result<a class="noteRef" href="#d5289e932">[21]</a>. The other patterns observed in these

                    algebra to take a very high-dimensional space (in this case, a 326-dimensional
                    space because of the 326 data points, or syllabic values) and projects it into a
                    two-dimensional space. An analysis using PCA always begins with a data table
                    whose rows are termed “objects” and whose columns are termed
                        “variables.” By analyzing the data points within this

                    simplification; data modeling; outlier detection; variable selection;
                    classification; prediction; or unmixing [<a class="ref" href="#wold1987">Wold et al. 1987</a>, 38]. The
                    primary goals of using PCA against the dataset in this study are to determine
                    outliers and select variables. To address these goals, PCA rotates the axes of
                    the data table in order to find the two axes that represent the most variation,
                    or principal components, within the data. In other words, PCA finds the set of
                    variables that explain the most variance found in the dataset. These variables,
                    or syllabic values in this case, can then be further examined using

                    the primary and secondary driving factors (the first and second principal

                    third principal component is less clear, but is presented here as a point of
                    comparison with the first two principal components. The syllabic values that
                    most significantly influence the variation in the data, as identified through

                    correlation between the principal components and the original variables is
                    called the component loadings. The component loadings are indicative of how much
                    of the total variation can be attributed to a given variable; in other words,
                    the higher the component loading is, the more important that variable is for
                    that component. For this reason, only syllabic values with loadings greater than
                    a particular threshold are considered further. The threshold varies for each
                    principal component, and is determined visually based on the graphs in Figures

                    cuneiform writing system. While similarities between syllabaries during
                    particular periods or within particular regions may have been assumed to exist,

                    in the results of these methods strongly suggests that there is indeed variation

                    the significant factors influencing the first principal component. The results

                        methods, to aid in the study of early scripts and cultures is a relatively
                        new enterprise. Near Eastern archaeologists have been using complementary
                        methods for some time, but most scholars of ancient texts and languages have
                        only recently begun to appreciate the utility of more advanced computational
                        modeling to help visualize and interpret data. As it stands, there are
                        several projects that aim to digitize significant numbers of cuneiform texts
                        for such analysis, and this first step of database compilation is indeed
                        necessary before further analysis can be conducted. Now that these databases
                        are in advanced stages of completion, the data can be visualized and
                        interpreted using more advanced computational modeling in order to answer
                        questions, which require data too extensive to be answered by examining
                        these texts by hand, about the language, culture, economy, and history of
                        early complex societies. Perhaps most relevantly, these methods will also be
                        readily applicable to other fields in the humanities and social
                        sciences.</div>

                        modern-day Iraq and Syria in the late third millennium BCE. A dataset was
                        curated of cuneiform sign values used to write Semitic words written on
                        tablets excavated from key geographic sites and used computational
                        techniques, including dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, to
                        achieve a broad view analysis of the curated data. These results directed
                        further inquiry, in which philological approaches were used to examine and

                        of analysis on this type of data: the results of the hierarchical clustering
                        and PCA were able to provide a more detailed and accurate analysis of the
                        data than the phylogenetic estimation method was. The results of this study
                        help in understanding the broad view of cuneiform script spread and
                        adaptation; however, there are ways such a study could be more rigorous. For
                        example, it would be preferable to use the encoded cuneiform signs as the
                        input data instead of using reconstructed syllabic sign values, since the
                        step of interpreting each sign value may introduce additional human error.
                        Currently, however, there is not a readily usable infrastructure to do this.

                        developments and relationships have been determined largely through a
                        combination of textual analysis and the comparative method [<a class="ref" href="#hetzron1969">Hetzron 1969</a>]

                        orthographies, or other aspects of the cuneiform script. In terms of future
                        research, this will be particularly useful in identifying the definitive

                        looted or misplaced tablets. To do this, a much larger dataset is required.
                        In particular, a large collection of digitized texts with adequate encoding
                        of the class of each sign (i.e., syllabic, logographic, determinative,
                        etc.). This dataset can rely largely on the texts published on the CDLI
                        database; computational methods could then be employed to identify the class
                        of the majority of signs attested in most time periods and genres. Once this
                        dataset is collected, principal component analysis can aid in the
                        identification of the distinctive signs or combinations of signs that, when
                        present, suggest a specific provenance. </div>
