                <p>Thomas Paine's <cite class="title italic">Rights of Man</cite> (Part I, 1791; Part II,
                    1792) is one of the most influential political tracts ever written. Recently,
                    Clark (2015) has queried the long-established notion that Part I is the work of
                    a single author, Paine himself. Clark argues that a passage of approximately
                    6000 words just prior to the “Declaration of the Rights of
                        Man and Citizens”, near midway through the book, was written by
                    Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, and inserted by Paine into his book,
                    perhaps with some editing. Clark's assertion rests mainly on judgement of the
                    tone and content of the queried passage, as well as a hint in a letter by
                    Lafayette to George Washington. This paper presents the results of a stylometric
                    study of this question. Three computational approaches to stylistic analysis —
                    one involving a consensus of six attribution techniques — were applied to the
                    text of the <cite class="title italic">Rights of Man</cite>, Part I, along with a
                    corpus of comparison texts from the same period. Our findings tend to
                    corroborate Clark's contention, as well as identifying two other short passages
                    in which Lafayette may have had a hand, thus rendering this important document
                    ripe for re-interpretation.</p>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">More than the writings of any other writer, those of Thomas Paine (1737-1809)
                    illustrate the transformation in the meaning of the term
                        “revolution” from the mid-eighteenth century to the
                    beginning of the nineteenth century; indeed Paine could lay claim to be the
                    world's first truly international revolutionary. Christopher Hitchens, in his
                    portrait of Paine [<a class="ref" href="#hitchens2006">Hitchens 2006</a>] argues for three possible sources for the fermentation at work within him:
                    (i) his upbringing with a Quaker father in the quasi-feudal Norfolk town of
                    Thetford; (ii) the time that Paine spent on the lower deck of the ship <cite class="title italic">King of Prussia</cite> in 1756 surrounded by a Royal Navy
                    crew of nonconformists; (iii) the influence of the London scene of taverns and
                    the working-man's lecture hall. On presenting himself to Benjamin Franklin and
                    receiving a rather tepid letter of recommendation, Paine set sail for
                    Philadelphia in 1774, arriving just as the colonial crisis with the British
                    motherland was mounting. From his own experience of being an ill-used civil
                    servant as an Excise officer, Paine was readier than most to advocate separation
                    and independence.</div>
                <div class="div div1">
                    <h2 class="head">1.1 Paine's Career as a Writer</h2>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">With the help of Dr. Benjamin Rush, who had suggested the title and also
                        found him a printer, in 1776 Paine published <cite class="title italic">Common
                            Sense</cite>. The result was a best seller on a scale hitherto unknown.
                        Linking an earthy appeal with an inspirational style, it did more than any
                        other publication to persuade America of the justice and necessity of
                        independence. Thereafter, Paine became a major figure in the pamphlet and
                        newspaper controversies of the Revolution, bringing his pen to bear whenever
                        he felt the American cause needed upholding, not least with his rallying cry
                        in <cite class="title italic">The American Crisis</cite>.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">In the five years after the end of the American Revolutionary War, Paine more
                        or less left politics behind and became absorbed in a series of scientific
                        experiments, in particular the design and construction of a single-arched
                        iron bridge. In 1787, again following the advice of Benjamin Franklin, who
                        told him he would do well to seek sponsors for his bridge in either Paris or
                        London, Paine returned to Europe at the very time when revolutionary and
                        radical pressures were building there. He did not lack for well-placed
                        friends. His admirer Thomas Jefferson had been appointed to be American
                        Minister to France, and his old friend The Marquis de Lafayette, wreathed
                        with American laurels, was also at his disposal. Lafayette kept a copy of
                        the American Declaration on one panel of his study, leaving the opposite
                        panel empty hoping it would be adorned one day by a similar French one [<a class="ref" href="#hitchens2006">Hitchens 2006</a>]. Lafayette had been prominent in the
                        parliamentary exchanges that led to the isolation of the French ruling
                        dynasty, was also the commander of the National Guard and in the thick of
                        the street demonstrations that had culminated in the fall of the Bastille on
                        14th July 1789. The French Revolution, which split British politics in
                        several directions, struck Paine as a natural extension of the American
                        one.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Paine's <cite class="title italic">Rights of Man</cite>, written as a defence of
                        the French Revolution, was issued in two parts. The first part (March 1791)
                        was dedicated to George Washington and the second part (February 1792),
                        calling for the spreading of the French Revolution across mainland Europe,
                        to Lafayette. At this point, the gloves started to come off with Paine
                        receiving a summons to appear in a British court and answer a charge of
                        seditious libel. The hand-picked jury outlawed him in his absence and Paine
                        never again returned to England. His time in France also turned out to be a
                        hazardous enterprise when he spoke out against the execution of Louis XVI
                        and backed the Gironde faction rather than the Jacobins. He was arrested in
                        December 1793, held in the Luxembourg prison, and only narrowly escaped the
                        guillotine due to a warder's error. The arrival in Paris of a new ambassador
                        — the future president James Monroe — saw Paine's release in November 1794.
                        His remaining years in France give the impression of the sour aftermath of a
                        love affair [<a class="ref" href="#hitchens2006">Hitchens 2006</a>]. In September 1797, the
                        irruption of the army into politics was confirmed by a military coup and in
                        November 1799 Napoleon arrogated all power to himself, proclaimed himself
                            “First Consul” and announced that the Revolution was
                        at an end.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Now Paine had fallen victim to a gigantic counter-revolution in revolutionary
                        disguise which had succeeded in entrenching his original foes — the
                        monarchy. Hearing from his old friend Thomas Jefferson that he was welcome
                        to return to America he gave up France as a bad job and in September 1802
                        sailed to Baltimore. His writings bear witness to his revolutionary
                        activities and provide us with a detailed picture of the evolution of social
                        and political change at the end of the eighteenth century.</div>

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Jonathan Clark, the Hall Distinguished Professor of British History at Kansas
                        University, calls into question the belief that Thomas Paine wrote the whole
                        work, in an article on the authorship of <cite class="title italic">Rights of
                            Man</cite> [<a class="ref" href="#clark2015">Clark 2015</a>]. Clark focuses on a 6000-word long passage, located just
                        before the “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of
                            Citizens”" (henceforth, for brevity, the
                        <em class="emph">Declaration</em>), which forms the central historical passage in
                        Part I. Paine prefaces this passage with the words “I will here, as concisely as I can, trace out the
                                growth of the French revolution, and mark the circumstances that
                                have contributed to produce it”
                             [<a class="ref" href="#philp2008">Philp 2008</a>]. Clark argues that (i) the passage differs in tone from the rest of
                        the work; (ii) the prose is unlike Paine's; (iii) it is mostly written in a
                        mandarin third person and does not display Paine's typically prominent
                        authorial voice; (iv) the content of the passage is unlike anything else in
                        Paine's writings since, elsewhere, he showed no significant knowledge of
                        French history and, more tellingly, did not elsewhere reveal knowledge of
                        French high politics. Clark asserts that, examined more closely, its prose
                        seems not to be that of an Englishman at all, reading instead like the
                        English prose of a native French speaker.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Who, then, could have written this 6000-word narrative? Clark suggests that
                        its author was probably The Marquis de Lafayette. It seems to embody not
                        neutral history but his very personal perspective on events and has as hero
                        none other than Lafayette himself. Clark thinks that this passage was
                        expressed in the third person in order to conceal the
                            “vanity” of its author and points out that earlier in
                        the <cite class="title italic">Rights of Man</cite> Paine acknowledges that
                        Lafayette had provided him with information and at least one document. The
                        strongest piece of evidence that Lafayette had supplied Paine with the
                        substance of the 6000-word narrative comes from Lafayette's own hand since
                        on 12th January 1790 he had written to George Washington “Common Sense
                            [Paine] is writing a Book for you — there you will see a part of My
                            Adventures.”</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Clark concludes that this passage is very probably not a history primarily
                        written by Paine but Lafayette's self-serving publicity, part of his attempt
                        to become the “George Washington” of the French
                        Revolution. What better way for Lafayette to publicize his own version of
                        events, with himself at the centre, than feeding his own interpretation to
                        his English friend? The consequences of accepting such an attribution would
                        be to render Paine's important writings open to general re-interpretation. A
                        computer-based stylometric investigation of this attribution is thus
                        merited.</div>

                    the authorship of the so-called “Pickett Letters” of the

                    essentially picks the N most common words in the corpus under investigation and
                    computes the normalized occurrence rate of these N words in each text-unit,
                    typically per 100 or per 1000, thus converting a set of P text-units into a
                    P-by-N array of numbers. Multivariate statistical techniques, most commonly
                    Principal Components Analysis and Cluster Analysis, are then applied to the data
                    to look for patterns. The former aims to reduce the dimensionality of the
                    problem by transforming the N variables to a smaller number (usually 2) of new
                    variables and the latter technique provides an independent and objective view of
                    groupings amongst the textual samples by means of a tree-diagram or dendrogram.
                    The Burrows-style approach has become the first port-of-call for attributional
                    problems and will be the initial technique adopted in this investigation.</div>

                    text units are too short to provide opportunities for stylistic habits to
                    operate on the arrangement of internal constituents, while larger units are
                    insufficiently frequent to provide enough examples for reliable statistical
                    inference. Forsyth and Holmes found the median text block size in a selection of
                    stylometric studies to be around 3500 words [<a class="ref" href="#forsyth1996">Forsyth and Holmes 1996</a>]. On the

                    adequate size for stylometric analysis, finding no correlation between the
                    correct assignment of an author and the length of text sample [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2008">Jockers et al. 2008</a>]. Eder examined a number of attribution methods in
                    several languages on a variety of text lengths and concluded that 2500 words or
                    more were needed for reliable attribution, though the figure varied somewhat
                    across genres and languages [<a class="ref" href="#eder2015">Eder 2015</a>]. More recently, Eder has
                    found that a diversity index can be computed prior to attribution which will
                    indicate whether conditions are such that samples down to 1500 words in length
                    or even slightly smaller can be reliably attributed [<a class="ref" href="#eder2017">Eder 2017</a>].
                    This issue is thus still subject to active research, so it was decided in this
                    initial phase of the analysis to start conservatively by working with texts of
                    2500 words or more in length. This criterion selected 55 text files including
                    the two prime queried texts TROM_Mid1 and TROM_Mid2, of 2950 and 3140 words

                        is very different from a variety of works by those contemporaries. Even

                        Hamilton, Jefferson and Madison. In short, this approach does offer clues to
                        authorship when applied to writings of the relevant vintage, provided that

                        no unambiguous interpretation). The leftmost of these five clusters is a

                        identification. For the present study, 29 of these 45 texts were used as
                        training data, leaving 16 as a holdout sample.</div>

                        In this phase, it repeatedly picks a random subsample of n texts from the
                        training data of N texts, where n = int(sqrt(N)). It then builds a model
                        using the remaining larger sample (size N-n) and uses that model to predict
                        the categories of the items in the smaller sample. In the present case, the
                        larger subsample would contain 24=29-5 texts and the smaller 5 texts. This
                        random subsampling is repeated until the required number of held-out items
                        have been classified (255 trials in the present instance). This implements a
                        mode of cross-validation, meaning that the success-rate statistics printed
                        at the end of this process should be a relatively unbiased estimate of how
                        the method would perform with fresh unseen data.</div>

                        the model generated from all 29 training texts to classifying the 16 holdout
                        texts, which it did not see during the training phase. Here the system
                        classifies each text as belonging to whichever class it estimates to be more
                        likely. It also ranks them according to a certainty measure, called
                            “credence”. This is simply the geometric mean of two
                        other scores, labelled “confidence” and
                            “congruity”. The system will always assign a class to
                        each holdout case: the point of this ranking is to alert users to cases
                        where this assignment is uncertain.</div>

                        training data. “Confidence” is calculated from the
                        difference between the maximum of these similarity scores, which determines
                        the category assigned, and the mean of the other similarity scores. A larger
                        difference indicates higher confidence, but the number used in this output
                        isn't the difference itself but an index of how far up in the ranking it

                        (of which there were 255 in this example). To be specific, if W is the
                        number of correct decisions with lower difference scores during the
                        subsampling phase and L is the number of incorrect decisions with lower
                        difference scores during that phase, then "confidence" is (W+L/2+0.5) /

                        similarity scores of the assigned category calculated during the subsampling
                        phase. Congruity is computed as (0.5 + B) / (S+1), where B is the number of
                        cases during the S subsampling trials in which the class selected had a
                        lower similarity score. Thus congruity uses the randomized trials to
                        estimate the empirical strength of similarity of the present case to its
                        assigned category, while confidence estimates how the gap between the chosen

                        a more genuinely problematic case. It is apparent that the document written
                        jointly by both the contrasted authors (CO_Feds_1995) sits almost exactly on
                        the borderline of the polarity between them. Interestingly, we see that
                        co-authored pieces where the second author isn't part of the contrast in
                        focus can be assigned quite confidently to the author who is part of that
                        contrast. The single distractor, MO_Autho_2014, does not gravitate strongly
                        towards either pole, although appearing somewhat more Forsythian than
                        Holmesian. The two pieces that land so close together as to render them
                        illegible are CO_FoundTran_2014 and RF_Fed4, both on the RF side.</div>

                        less than about 0.4 cannot confidently be ascribed to either of the two
                        authors being compared, as this implies a relatively neutral polarity whose
                        small difference from zero could easily be due to chance. This would put 6
                        of the 16 texts into a zone of uncertainty. The two texts deepest into this
                        zone of uncertainty are RF_Fed1 and DH_Fed5. These are the (historical)
                        introduction and conclusions sections respectively. Although we wrote these
                        individually, they are the most general sections, arising out of many
                        discussions and attempting to convey a coherent overall message. Perhaps it
                        is unsurprising that we achieved something like a common style for this
                        joint enterprise. By contrast, in parts 2, 3 and 4, we were describing the
                        results of applying our own specialized analytical techniques. It is
                        evident, therefore, that despite using methods that rely mainly on frequent
                        function words or part-of-speech tags, the factors of topic and/or genre
                        still have some influence on the classification process. Hence this method
                        is only partially immune to effects other than authorship.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4643e2106">[1]</a></div>

                        the classifier was framed as a dichotomy, to distinguish Paine from all

                        composite “author”? This choice is primarily dictated by
                        the practical consideration that we have many fewer documents in English by
                        the prime suspect for the other contributor to TROM, namely the Marquis of
                        Lafayette, than by Paine -- and those only in genres (autobiography and
                        letters) which are relatively rare in Paine's corpus. Nevertheless, we find
                        encouragement in taking this route from the finding of Sigelman et al.
                        (1997) that Paine's writing style is indeed markedly different from 14 other
                        authors contemporary with him [<a class="ref" href="#sigelman1997">Sigelman et al. 1997</a>]. Thus, posing a
                        contrast of Paine versus the rest (where the rest includes Lafayette among
                        seven other authors: see Appendix 1) is not purely fanciful. The ultimate
                        justification is pragmatic: does it shed light on the question at stake?</div>

                        For example, the span ('it', 'is') defines a triple containing 'it' and 'is'
                        in that order along with one other word not in the high-frequency list,
                        which in this case consisted of 112 words. Thus “perhaps it
                            is”, “it surely is” and “it is

                        quotation. The four <cite class="title italic">Federalist</cite> essays are only
                            “queried” in the sense that James Madison probably
                        wrote most of them, but Alexander Hamilton may have contributed to some
                        extent (mainly to numbers 19 and 20). In any case, they definitely weren't

                        Paine. Thus all 10 items with a credence score above 0.4 are correctly
                        attributed, five to each side. Two of the non-Paine texts with authors
                        present in the training data, namely Lafayette's letter to George Washington
                        (Lafa_toWas_1779), written in June 1779, and Jefferson's Notes on the State
                        of Virginia (Jeff_Notes) fall on the non-Paine side of the polarity, but
                        with relatively weak confidence. In the case of Lafayette's letter, it is
                        interesting to note that it falls almost exactly in the same position as

                        translation. Lafayette is known to have played a part in drafting this
                        famous declaration, so the idea that he assisted Paine with rendering it

                        performing exactly as required. As regards the genuinely queried items, all
                        four of them also fall into the zone of uncertainty. On this evidence, there
                        is no reason to doubt Iona College's de-attribution of both <cite class="title italic">African Slavery in America</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Reflections on Unhappy Marriages</cite> (Quer_Afric,
                        Quer_Unhap). They certainly do not typify Paine's writing style. Nor do the
                        two halves of the suspect 6000-word section identified by Clark. Given that
                        TROM_Rights_1, the part of the book leading up to them, emerges as the most
                        strongly Paine-like of all 20 holdout texts, this corroborates the
                        contention that the queried passage is unlikely to have been written by
                        Paine alone. In fact, these two pieces behave under this form of analysis
                        almost exactly like the unquestioned co-authorship (by Holmes &amp; Forsyth)
                        of section 4.1, falling near the borderline on this polarity between

                        contention. In this connection it may be worth noting that TROM_Mid2, the
                        second half of the doubtful passage is rated somewhat more similar to Paine
                        than the first half. This could be a genre effect, in that the former
                        section is a brief history of the dramatic events leading up to the King's
                        journey from Versailles to attend the Parliament in Paris in which a
                        starring role is played by a certain M. de la Fayette — rather like some
                        parts of the autobiographical work <cite class="title italic">Lafayette in
                            America</cite>. TROM_Mid2 also deals with stirring events, including
                        the storming of the Bastille, but this mainly consists of a reference to a
                        fuller description earlier in the book, and in general this part is rather
                        more in keeping with the reflective parts of the book which come after the
                            <cite class="title italic">Declaration</cite>, and are presumably by Paine
                        himself. It is not unreasonable to suppose that, even if Lafayette provided
                        a ready-made account, Paine might more heavily edit the more philosophic
                        portions than accounts of events to which Lafayette was personally a
                        witness. Still, this difference is minor: neither portion is typical of

                    together the separate portions of <cite class="title italic">Lafayette In
                        America</cite> I &amp; II, to restore them as two whole works; we also

                    block within the 40000+ words of TROM. The y-axis uses Burrows's Delta as a
                    distance measure, based on the 100 most frequent word tokens. Block size chosen
                    was 1000 words with an increment of 500; thus the first block consists of words
                    1-1000, the second of words 501-1500, the next of words 1001-2000 and so on.</div>

                    red line is in almost all places the most distant from the TROM sections,
                    presumably indicating a genre difference: it is an inter-personal letter
                    (written in English). However, there are three sections where the lowest, i.e.
                    most similar, text is by Lafayette. The first of these starts at position 6000;
                    the second at position 9000; and the third falls between 23000 and 25000, almost
                    in the middle of the passage queried by Clark.</div>

                    that two earlier sections of the work are also atypical of Paine's style, and
                    indeed similar to Lafayette's. To investigate this further, we applied a second
                    function supplied with the stylo package, namely rolling.classify(). For this we
                    again used a block size of 1000 words with a step size of 500. Other settings
                    were system defaults. We used the same comparison texts, except that Hamilton's

                    also intriguing. To investigate these in particular, we developed a sequential
                    version of the TOCCATA software described earlier which allows us to use
                    TOCCATA's methods in a “rolling” fashion on a single queried

                    feature set and a different way of calculating similarity (the Vote method,
                    described in Appendix 5). It also made it slightly easier to identify the
                    precise locations of the passages rated atypical of Paine.</div>

                    the leave-1-out method of cross-validation in which one text at a time is
                    removed from the training sample and a block of the requested size is taken at
                    random from this left-out text (or two blocks if the text is large enough), to
                    be classified by a model formed from the remaining training texts. Since TOCCATA
                    models produce similarity scores, this permits collection of a series of
                    similarity scores of text blocks not used to form the model when compared with
                    that model. This set is sorted and can be used in the subsequent phase to yield
                    empirical “centile” scores for each block in the queried
                    text. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p100">100</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p100">For example, let us consider a case using deltoid similarity (1/Delta, since
                    TOCCATA works with similarities not dissimilarities). If the training texts
                    yield 80 blocks of the requisite size having deltoid similarity scores ranging
                    from 0.8 to 2.5 with reference to the models built by excluding each of those 80
                    blocks in turn, these 80 numbers can be sorted and saved for phase 2. Let us
                    further suppose that the 8th and 9th largest of these 80 similarity values are
                    1.7 and 1.6.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p101">101</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p101">In phase 2, the program runs sequentially through the blocks of the test text.
                    For each block a similarity score is computed comparing the text block to the
                    training-set model. This score is not used directly; instead it is expressed as
                    a centile or percentage with reference to the set generated during the
                    leave-1-out phase. To continue the above example, if the deltoid similarity for
                    a given block were 1.65 this would place it between the 8th and 9th highest of
                    the values retained from phase 1. This beats all but 8 (=72) of the 80 scores, so would be given a centile score of 72/80, or 90 in percentage terms. Thus
                    the centile score for each block in the test text is the percentage of
                    similarity scores obtained during the cross-validation phase which are beaten
                    by, i.e. lower than, the score obtained for the block concerned by applying the
                    classification model to the text under consideration.</div>

                    available in TOCCATA, some of which have no natural interpretation, and this
                    puts them all onto a common scale. Another point is that the initial
                    cross-validation phase gives an unbiased empirical estimate of the expected
                    distribution of similarity scores for unseen blocks of this size, of known
                    category, when compared with a model formed from a training set of that

                    contention of Jonathan Clark (2015) is highly credible [<a class="ref" href="#clark2015">Clark 2015</a>]. A long passage of text within TROM leading up to the Declaration of Rights
                    itself is very uncharacteristic of Tom Paine's famously distinctive writing
                    style. We have also identified two earlier, shorter but still substantial,
                    passages that are atypical in language with respect to Paine's other
                    writings.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p115">115</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p115">All three passages refer to momentous historical events, so the possibility
                    remains that Paine adapted his habitual language when writing in a genre that he
                    seldom otherwise used. Nevertheless, Paine's familiarity with Lafayette, who had
                    first-hand knowledge of these events, along with the fact that the main queried
                    passage yields results very like those of our known co-authorship (subsection
                    4.1), leads us to believe that some degree of co-authorship is the most likely
                    explanation. The fact that all three passages assign a central role to Lafayette
                    merely strengthens this belief.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p116">116</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p116">A likely scenario is that Lafayette supplied written descriptions of the events
                    about which he knew more than Paine, which Paine then inserted into his book at
                    points he considered suited to the thrust of his argument, with greater or
                    lesser degrees of editing. Stylometry alone cannot prove this. The putative
                    co-authors are dead. But the stylometric evidence presented here is entirely
                    consistent with such a supposition.</div>

                    of this method within the field of computational stylistics [<a class="ref" href="#eder2016">Eder 2016</a>]. We consider that our use of more than one

                    such procedures represents a contribution to this subfield, and intend to work

                        “words” and “tokens” are
                    interchangeable (provided that numbers are considered as words). In particular,
                    punctuation symbols were ignored, although in many circumstances — e.g. when

                        authorship attribution studies. In a nutshell, this method first finds the
                        most frequent N word tokens in the corpus; then computes the means and
                        standard deviations of the relative usage rates of these words across the
                        various documents of the corpus. This allows it to consider the mean usage
                        rates of these words in each category as a model of that class. To compare a
                        single text with a class model, it computes the absolute z-scores of all
                        these words and averages them, a z-score being computed by subtracting the
                        usage rate of the word under consideration in the text from the mean rate in
                        the class model and dividing this difference (ignoring sign) by the standard
                        deviation of that word in the corpus as a whole. This process yields a mean
                        absolute z-score, which is a dissimilarity measure. Because TOCCATA works
                        with similarities, these mean dissimilarities (d<span class="hi subscript">i</span>)
                        are converted to similarities as 1.0/d<span class="hi subscript">i</span>. The
                        number, N, of most-frequent words to employ is a user-selectable parameter
                        but if this is absent the system sets N to be the square root of the
                        vocabulary size V (i.e. total different vocabulary items, not total running
                        tokens), which is usually a reasonable choice. In the present study the
                        default, N=round(sqrt(V)), was used. </div>

                        MAWS, Mosteller And Wallace System) [<a class="ref" href="#mosteller1984">Mosteller and Wallace 1984</a>]. The implementation in TOCCATA is a
                        slight revision of the software originally in Forsyth's PhD thesis [<a class="ref" href="#forsyth1995">Forsyth 1995</a>] to automate this approach. Essentially this is a
                        naive Bayesian classifier using frequent word tokens. It takes 2 parameters,
                        toks2get and multivox (default values 144 and 1.618034 respectively) and
                        computes the rounded value of toks2get multiplied by multivox. It then takes
                        the resulting number of the most common words in the corpus, according to
                        document frequency, and reduces them to toks2get again by discarding the
                        least discriminatory items. Then Bayes factors are computed from the
                        training data for each remaining token according to how often the relative
                        frequency of that token exceeds the median frequency of that token in the
                        whole corpus.</div>

                        the training corpus as a feature. The “model” developed
                        for classification consists simply of frequency-tables for every text
                        category, containing the frequency of that word in that category. To
                        classify a new text, the frequency of every word in that text is counted;
                        then, for each category, a similarity score is computed by adding a
                            “vote” by each word in the text to a running total.
                        The vote is either sqrt(f) or 0, where f is the frequency of that word in
                        the text being classified , according to whether the word's relative
                        frequency is more common in the category concerned than in the corpus as a
                        whole, or not. The category yielding the highest total is chosen. This
                        simple procedure was intended merely to establish a baseline, but various
                        trials have shown that it works rather well, perhaps because information

                            <em class="term">syllexis</em>, the co-occurrence of words in close proximity,
                        and especially sequential co-occurrence. Being aimed at authorship
                        attribution it starts, conventionally enough, by finding the most common
                        words in the corpus. The number kept can be set by the user but by default
                        is the square root of the vocabulary size, rounded to an integer, with an
                        enforced maximum of 1024. Frequency is defined not by gross count but by the
                        number of snippets in which a word occurs. Default snippet size is 144
                        tokens. Thus dispersed words that occur throughout the corpus are favoured
                        over "bursty" words that occur often but only in few segments. This
                        preliminary word-selection can be considered step 0 of the overall
                        procedure, after which follow a further four steps: (1) accumulate; (2)
                        eliminate; (3) correlate; (4) discriminate. Steps 1 and 2 constitute the
                        model-building phase; steps 3 and 4 form the model-using phase.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p126">126</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p126">Step 1 goes through the texts examining each segment of S consecutive words,
                        where S is a parameter called spansize, set by the user. With spansize=3, as
                        in the trials reported above, the triplet “by the user”,
                        for example, would be examined and — presuming “by” and
                            “the” were in the frequent word list but
                            “user” was not — the tuple
                            (“by”,“the”) would be retained
                        with 1 added to its occurrence tally. This typically generates a very large
                        number of token tuples, most of which are shorter than spansize in length.
                        In fact, the zero-length tuple is normally one of the most frequent —
                        implying a segment of S tokens all absent from the high-frequency list. Most
                        of these tuples are winnowed out in step 2. In this step any such tuples
                        occurring in fewer than 2 texts are removed, and, more significantly, the
                        tuples are rated by how strongly they are associated with each category,
                        with only the most distinctive retained. The default mode of calculating
                        distinctiveness is to compute (r1-r2)*sqrt(df), where r1 is the rate in the
                        category under consideration, r2 is the rate in all other categories
                        combined and df is the number of documents of the category under
                        consideration in which the token occurs. The highest-scoring items in each
                        category are kept. The number to keep for each category is the rounded
                        square root of that category's vocabulary size. The lists for each category
                        are then merged and become a list of distinctive features. In phase 3 this
                        distinctive-feature list is used to calculate a correlation coefficient
                        (rank correlation by default) for each test text with each category in the
                        following manner. The frequencies of every distinctive feature in the text
                        under consideration, including zero, form one vector which is correlated
                        with vectors of the total frequencies of those features in each category,
                        giving C correlations, where C is the number of categories. In step 4, the
                        highest of those correlations is chosen to assign a category to the text
                        concerned.</div>

                        different parameter settings. Among the chief differences are that sets of
                        tokens were collected, not tuples, i.e. that sequence within spans was
                        ignored, and that part-of-speech tags (as assigned by the GoTagger; see
                        Appendix 6) were used as tokens not orthographic words. In addition, the
                        spansize parameter was set to 5. Hence, again, many sets chosen as features
                        consist of less than 5 items. For example, the quintet “the point
                            of this method” would be tagged as “dt nn of dt nn” and
                        would thus generate the potential feature ['dt', 'nn', 'of'], since sets
                        don't include replications. (On output, the items are listed in alphabetic
                        order, which may not reflect the order in the original text.)</div>

                        text category and the most frequent at each size retained. Thus, for
                        instance, in Tom Paine's writings the following 4- and 3-grams were kept,

                        computed. Thus, if the text contained the 8-gram "the people of the united
                        states of america" that would count as 8 tokens covered by a combination of
                        the three items above: "the people of" would be marked as covered by the
                        3-gram; "of the united states" would be covered by the first 4-gram; "united
                        states of america" would be covered by the second 4-gram. The fact that some
                        words were covered twice wouldn't matter. The eventual similarity score
                        would only depend on what proportion of tokens in the text being classified
                        had been covered overall, not on how many times each word was covered nor
                        how many times particular n-grams had been found in the text. Note that any

                            of. I am not undertaking the detail of the attack, but bringing into

                            with the Bastille. The prison to which the new ministry were dooming the

                            up the new ministry, who began now to fly from the ruin they had
                            prepared for others. The troops of Broglio dispersed, and himself fled

                            concealed for safety's sake, as Mr. Burke insinuates. Matters being thus
                            appeased, and tranquility restored, a general acclamation broke forth of
                            Le Roi a Paris- Le Roi a Paris- The King to Paris. It was the shout of
                            peace, and immediately accepted on the part of the King. By this measure
                            all future projects of trapanning the King to Metz, and setting up the
                            standard of opposition to the constitution, were prevented, and the
                            suspicions extinguished. The King and his family reached Paris in the
                            evening, and were congratulated on their arrival by M. Bailly, the Mayor
                            of Paris, in the name of the citizens. Mr. Burke, who throughout his
                            book confounds things, persons, and principles, as in his remarks on M.
                            Bailly's address, confounded time also. He censures M. Bailly for
                            calling it "un bon jour," a good day. Mr. Burke should have informed
                            himself that this scene took up the space of two days, the day on which
                            it began with every appearance of danger and mischief, and the day on
                            which it terminated without the mischiefs that threatened; and that it
                            is to this peaceful termination that M. Bailly alludes, and to the
                            arrival of the King at Paris. Not less than three hundred thousand
                            persons arranged themselves in the procession from Versailles to Paris,
                            and not an act of molestation was committed during the whole

                            it. The Assembly of the Notables has in some places been mistaken for
                            the States-General, but was wholly a different body, the States-General
                            being always by election. The persons who composed the Assembly of the
                            Notables were all nominated by the king, and consisted of one hundred
                            and forty members. But as M. Calonne could not depend upon a majority of
                            this Assembly in his favour, he very ingeniously arranged them in such a
                            manner as to make forty-four a majority of one hundred and forty; to
                            effect this he disposed of them into seven separate committees, of
                            twenty members each. Every general question was to be decided, not by a
                            majority of persons, but by a majority of committee, and as eleven votes
                            would make a majority in a committee, and four committees a majority of
                            seven, M. Calonne had good reason to conclude that as forty-four would
                            determine any general question he could not be outvoted. But all his
                            plans deceived him, and in the event became his overthrow. [....]</td>

                        originally in French. They were translated into English for the 1837 edition
                        of Lafayette's works, but the editor does not state by whom. Thus it is safe
                        to treat them as not being by Thomas Paine, although treating them as
                        definitely by Lafayette is problematic. In this connection, however, it is
